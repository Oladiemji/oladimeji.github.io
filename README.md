# The objectives of this project are as follows:

The primary objective of this project was to develop a predictive model to accurately forecast customer churn within the telecommunications industry. Utilizing historical customer data, I applied machine learning techniques to identify and analyze relevant features that influence churn behavior. The project focused on creating a robust model capable of predicting which customers are likely to discontinue services. The effectiveness of the model was measured using appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
